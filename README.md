# How to host an online resume and README

## Purpose

The purpose of this README is to help you format a resume by using GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

Firstly, before continuing, we will need the following things installed, you will need Git, Ruby, and a MarkDown editor such as Visual Studio.   Once we have completed all the necessary prerequisites we can now start following the instructions on how to host your resume on a static site.

## Instructions

### Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll

#### Create a repository for your site
We will assume this is your first time making a repository so we will go step by step.

1. Go on the GitHub Pages site and sign in or create an account.
2. In the top-right corner of the page you should see a drop-down menu with a + symbol, click it and select New repository.
3. For the repository name type in <user>.github.io, and all uppercase letters in the name must be in lowercase.
4. Select the repository visibility you desire, each option has a small description that describes what it does.
